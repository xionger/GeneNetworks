# GeneNetworks
Capstone project for [Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented) offered by Coursera/UCSD.

This project can create gene network graph based on gene relationship data from scientific publications, analyze the most possible connections between any two genes, and help to investigate which genes may function together.

The gene networks are analyzed by implementing BFS, Dijkstra's and Girvan-Newman Algorithm.
